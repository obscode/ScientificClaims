# ScientificClaims
Inquiry-based activity which is part of the Carnegie Astrophysics Summer Student Internship (CASSI)

In this repository you will find the jupyter-notebook used for  the 
Communications Workshop:  Making Scientific Claims using Plots. Aside from
the `FitCepheid.ipynb` notebook, there is also a support module 
(`cepheid_template.py`) and data needed for the activity.
